# Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Level-Prediction
Data Science project predicting and categorising households poverty level using family’s observable attributes as poorest cannot provide required income and expense records to prove that they qualify for financial aid.


The problem statement we chose “Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction”
is for classifying households that are in dire need of social welfare assistance.
The motivation for solving this problem using Data Science techniques lies in the fact that
the poorest cannot provide required income and expense records to prove that they
qualify for financial aid.
The traditional econometrics approach is to use Proxy Means Test (PMT), most
commonly used in Latin America. This method uses the family’s observable
attributes to categorise and predict their level of need. 
However, the accuracy of the PMT method remains a big issue as the population grows and poverty declines.
Therefore, Inter-American Development Bank has provided the data to the Kaggle
Community to devise novel solutions using Machine Learning methods to identify
these households with improved accuracy. 
These solutions can be used toaccurately gauge the level of social need in other countries as well.
